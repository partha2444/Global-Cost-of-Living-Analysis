## 📊 Executive Summary

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of economic disparities across **130+ countries**, focusing on the critical relationship between **Cost of Living**, **Rent**, and **Local Purchasing Power**. 

In a globalized economy, simply comparing prices (Cost of Living) is misleading without accounting for local salaries (Purchasing Power). This analysis aims to reveal the true "Standard of Living" by normalizing these metrics and identifying countries that offer the highest economic value.

### 🔍 Key Findings
* **The "Affordability" Gap:** While countries like **Switzerland** and **Bermuda** rank as the most expensive globally (Indices > 120), the **United States** leads significantly in **Purchasing Power**, offering the best salary-to-expense ratio.
* **High Correlation:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed a **strong correlation (0.91)** between Rent and Grocery indices, indicating that housing costs are the primary driver of overall living expenses globally.
* **Developing Economies:** **India** ranks as the **3rd most affordable country** in the world (Cost Index: ~24.4), making it a prime location for cost-effective operations, though it faces lower purchasing power parity compared to Western economies.
* **Hidden Gems:** The analysis identified "High Value" economies (e.g., **Saudi Arabia**, **South Africa**) that maintain a low Cost of Living (< 50) while offering a high Purchasing Power (> 80).

### 🛠️ Methodology
The dataset was processed using **Python (Pandas)** to clean anomalies, standardized column naming conventions, and filter for relevant economic indicators. Visualizations were generated using **Seaborn** and **Plotly** to map global disparities.
